[Link to Deployed Application](https://505laura.github.io/module-2-challenge)

## Description
This website is designed to be a personal web development portfolio that will showcase the works of the creator as well as provide ways to learn more about them and/or get in contact. It is intended to give potential employers an indication of their capabilities. It includes an 'about', 'portfolio' and 'contact' section as well as links to social medias.

The code is designed to be semantic and have a logical layout. The CSS includes multiple different sections to provide clear divides in the styling of each part of the content.

## Usage
### Navigation
Use the 'About', 'Portfolio' and 'Contact' links located at the top right of the website to direct you straight to the content you would like to see. The 'Resume' link will be added soon.
You can also use the arrow below the first text section to take you to the portfolio.

### Social Media Sidebar
There is a fixed sidebar on the bottom right of the screen that contains links to GitHub, Twitter and Instagram. These sites can be accessed once you click on the images.

### Portfolio Section
The 'Portfolio' section includes images that can be hovered over and clicked on. The first two will bring you to projects that have been pushed to GitHub.

### Contact Section
The 'Contact' section features an 'Email Me' button that once clicked on, will open the email application with the authors email already entered in the field. 
There is also a form that potential visitors to the site can use to get in touch with the creator. They can do so by entering their email and a message (required) and optionally, their name and phone number.

## Roadmap
This website will be updated frequently as new projects are completed and are ready to be displayed. This will be a continuous process as the author learns new technologies and furthers their skills and knowledge.
